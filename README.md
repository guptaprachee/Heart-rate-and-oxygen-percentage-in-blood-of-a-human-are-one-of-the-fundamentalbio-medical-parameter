Heart rate and oxygen percentage in blood of a human are one of the fundamentalbio-medical parameters analysed for study as well as medical diagnosis. Both theseparameters should be within a certain prescribed range otherwise it may indicate asevere abnormality in the human body.  In this work we propose Pulse Oxi Meterthat measures these two parameters. In this prototype, we adopt a module, known asPulse oxi Meter which measures number of heart beats per second i.e. heart rate andoxygen percentage in blood which is also called asSpO2percentage in a non-invasiveway and are displayed on a LCD.
